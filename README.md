# mpower-shiny

This Shiny app provides a GUI for researchers to interact with simulation-based power anlaysis results created by R package [mpower](https://github.com/phuchonguyen/mpower) for a few pre-defined data set, sample sizes, effect sizes, inference models, and significance threshold.

## Getting started

To download and run the app in R, run:

```{r}
shiny::runGitHub("mpower-shiny", "evaengel")
```
## How can we make the app more useful to you?

This Shiny app is still under development. We would like to know what chemicals, effect sizes, inference models researchers would find most useful to include in the app. You can submit your suggestions through this Google form: https://forms.gle/xYx2hXWQbfZx7ZJC8.

Thank you for your time and feedback!
